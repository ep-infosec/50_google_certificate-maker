# CONFIGURING THE RESULTING PDF

# You can use a subset of the options provided by Puppeteer's
# PDF function here. Learn more at:

#  https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.11.0/docs/api.md#pagepdfoptions

# SPECIFY THE DESIRED FILENAME

# The intermediary files and resulting certificate PDF files
# will be saved using the pattern you specify below. You can
# insert values from your data source here the way you do in
# the HTML files!

# If the column header isn't a valid variable name, like if
# if it contains spaces, you can access it like so:

#   {{ h["COLUMN HEADER NAME"] }}

file_name: Certificate for {{ Name }}


# SETTING UP YOUR DATA SOURCE

# Certificate Maker can take a CSV file or a Google Sheet as
# a data source. If both are specified, it will choose the CSV
# file.

# By default, this example reads from an included CSV file.
# If you want to test with a Google Sheet, be sure to comment
# out the CSV file value below!

csv_file: docs/example.csv

# The example Google Sheet referenced below is read-only, so
# you'll need to clone it then insert your new sheet's ID below.
# If you don't, Certificate Maker will not be able to save the
# path or URL to the resulting certificate PDF files.

# google_sheet_id: 1liFiBCoyKv3Slt0sJJxvU9wb_Kbr3aejaa0HiPrxvOU
# worksheet: Sheet1


# UPLOADING RESULTS TO GOOGLE DRIVE

# If you want to test uploading the resulting PDF files to
# Google Drive, change the value below to true, then add the ID
# number for the specific Google Drive folder you'd like to
# put the files in - make sure to uncomment that line!

upload: false
